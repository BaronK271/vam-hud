# VAM HUD
An unobtrusive and configurable Heads-Up-Display for Virt-A-Mate.

# Installation
Place the `VAM-HUD.cs` file in your VAM Scripts folder.

# Usage
Load the script as a **Session** plugin.

By default, it displays the current FPS in the bottom right corner.
You can configure the plugin to:

- select which corner displays information
- display FPS
- display the total number of atoms in the scene
- display the current load folder (i.e. the folder the current scene is locatedin)

The plugin will honor the "Draw UI on Top" VAM setting in the Misc Settings tab.
